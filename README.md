# py-to-player
A raspberry pi, RFID controlled, audio player for children

These are mostly notes so that I can recall the steps to recreate this project if I need to.

The aim is to create a music/audio book player that will play local files when triggered with an RFID card/sticker. The output device is an existing Amazon Alexa that will be connected with Bluetooth.

## Equipment list
- Raspberry Pi zero W
- RC522 RFID
- NTAG-213 stickers
- Amazon Alexa Dot

## RC522 pin configuration
- SDA connects to Pin 24.
- SCK connects to Pin 23.
- MOSI connects to Pin 19.
- MISO connects to Pin 21.
- GND connects to Pin 6.
- RST connects to Pin 22.
- 3.3v connects to Pin 1.

## Raspberry Pi configuration
I used a pi zero w as this was readibly available with the header already soldered.

### Enable SPI
- `sudo raspi-config`
- Interfacing Options
- SPI
- Activate > Yes > OK

### Install packages
- 
   
### Disable built-in audio (the HDMI, that I do not want to use)
- `sudo nano /boot/config.txt`
- #dtparam=audio=on

### Raspberry Pi Audio Configuration (Making the Bluetooth Speaker work)
Setting the audio out to use the bluetooth speaker is slightly trickier. 

Pair the bluetooth speaker:

-`bluetoothctl -a`
-`pair 44:3D:54:B9:30:55 `
-`trust 44:3D:54:B9:30:55`

After pairing the bluetooth speaker in the GUI, identify the audio sinks using:

- `pacmd list-sinks`

Initially I tried to set a default sink in the conf file using the name of the sink (this is recommended as the sink number can change).

- `/etc/pulse/client.conf.`

As the default sink in the conf file proved unreliable, I created a shell script that launches on boot via the cron tab

- `sudo crontab -e `

- `@reboot sh /launch.sh`

launch.sh contains the following.

- `echo "disconnect 44:3D:54:B9:30:55" | bluetoothctl`

- `echo "connect 44:3D:54:B9:30:55" | bluetoothctl`

- `pacmd "set-default-source bluez_sink.44_3D_54_B9_30_55.a2dp_sink.monitor"`

With these settings, the Raspberry Pi will connect to the Alexa on reboot.

Next, I need the python script to launch after a reboot. I did this by adding the following to the crontab

- `add crontab code here`

## Python environment
To make this work we need to use the library for the RFID reader. I used https://github.com/pimylifeup/MFRC522-python

This library worked well as I don't need to be able to write to the RDIF stickers as I'm only using the NTAG-213 stickers to read the ID and use this to determine what audio to play (the audio files are simply called the name of the NTAG + .mp3. This allows me to use the NTAG-213 stickers that you get lots of on Amazon/ebay for just a few Â£ - cheap and cheerful.

## Python script
This is mostly commented in the code. The intention was to set the RFID reader to read a tag when it was presented. If the tag matched a file (TAGID + .mp3) then that file would be played; if the tag matched a directory (TAGID) then the files in that directory would be played in a random order.

I also created a couple of 'helper tags' that each call a function:

- One that stops any audio that is playing
- One that reconnects the bluetooth speaker

## Playing the audio
To play the audio you tap the RFID with the NTAG-213 sticker. To make this easy, we stuck these on the barcodes of the books that we had recorded audio for.

We also created some custom cards using a MIFARE RFID card that were decorated to identify what would be played.
